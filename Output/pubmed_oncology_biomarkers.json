{'abstract': 'Mounting evidence indicates that periodontitis may play a '
             'contributory role in the pathogenesis of systemic diseases, '
             'including cancer, primarily through mechanisms involving chronic '
             'inflammation and immune dysregulation. Nonetheless, the specific '
             'immunoinflammatory pathways that underpin the relationship '
             'between periodontitis and solid tumors remain only partially '
             'elucidated. To conduct a systematic review of original clinical '
             'studies that examine the immunoinflammatory mechanisms '
             'potentially linking periodontitis with the initiation or '
             'progression of solid malignancies. Adhering to the Preferred '
             'Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses '
             '(PRISMA) 2020 framework, we conducted a comprehensive literature '
             'search across four major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of '
             'Science, and Embase) through March 2025. Eligible studies were '
             'limited to original human research that investigated the '
             'association between periodontitis and solid tumors with an '
             'emphasis on immunological or inflammatory biomarkers. Following '
             'a rigorous screening process, 19 studies met the inclusion '
             'criteria and were analyzed. A consistent body of evidence across '
             'the included studies suggests a significant association between '
             'periodontitis and heightened risk or severity of various solid '
             'tumors, notably colorectal, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and '
             'breast cancers. Common immunoinflammatory signatures observed '
             'among affected individuals included elevated systemic levels of '
             'cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, altered immune cell profiles '

{'abstract': 'Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly refractory to most treatments. '
             'Multimodal treatment, combining several types of therapies, is '
             'likely to benefit PC patients. However, it remains unclear which '
             'multimodal treatment is most effective and how to predict '
             'outcomes from different combinations. This study compared '
             'overall survival among PC patients receiving chemotherapy alone '
             '(C), immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy (CI), radiotherapy '
             'combined with chemotherapy (CR), and triple-combination therapy '
             '(CRI). A machine learning-based predictive model between '
             'monomodal and multimodal therapy was established using 3 years '
             'of clinical follow-up data. We retrospectively analyzed 125 '

{'abstract': 'Glioma is the most common malignant tumor in the central nervous '
             'system, with unclear pathogenesis and poor treatment outcomes. '
             'Recent research reveals that the brain-gut axis-involving gut '
             'microbiota and immune activity-influences central nervous system '

             '(miRNAs), in different types of specimens. The present study '

             'detection in cervical cancer precursor lesions by comparing '
             'plasma, urine and liquid-based cytology (LBC). A total of 798 '

             'equally divided between those with high-grade cervical '
             'intraepithelial neoplasia (2/3) and controls with negative Pap '
             'and human papillomavirus tests. Comparative analyses revealed '
             'that LBC exhibited the highest detection efficiency, with only '
             '1.75% of miRNAs demonstrating low counts, compared with 20.68% '
             'in plasma and 15.79% in urine. Additionally, LBC exhibited 21.3% '
             'of miRNAs above the 9th decile of expression, compared with '
             '5.89% in plasma and 2.88% in urine. LBC revealed the most '

             'its potential as the most effective specimen for detecting '
             'cervical cancer precursor lesions biomarkers. Plasma also showed '
             'promise as a detection medium, whilst urine exhibited higher '

             'demonstrated the highest efficacy for miRNA detection among the '

{'abstract': 'Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a leading cause of cancer-related '
             'mortality. Protein succinylation, a key post-translational '
             'modification, is implicated in tumor progression. However, its '
             'comprehensive landscape and clinical significance in LUAD remain '
             'largely unexplored. We integrated multi-omics data from The '
             'Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) '
             'cohorts. A set of core succinylation-related genes was '
             'identified through differential expression and univariable Cox '
             'regression analyses. Molecular subtypes based on succinylation '
             'were determined by principal component analysis (PCA). A '
             'succinylation prognostic model was constructed via least '
             'absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and '
             'multivariable Cox regression. The differences of tumor '
             'microenvironment (TME), tumor mutation burden and drug '
             'sensitivity in different risk groups were further explored. '

             'High-dimensional weighted gene co-expression networks analysis '
             '(hdWGCNA) was used to identify potential succinylation-related '

             'defined three molecular subtypes with distinct prognostic and '
             'TME characteristics. A robust 7-gene succinylation-based '

{'abstract': 'Metastasis, the primary cause of cancer-related mortality, is '
             'sustained by complex interactions between tumor cells and '
             'host-derived factors. Extracellular vesicles, membrane-bound '
             'particles that mediate intercellular communication, have emerged '
             'as critical regulators of this process. Among them, '
             'platelet-derived extracellular vesicles represent the most '
             'abundant EV population in circulation and extend the '
             'multifaceted influence of platelets in cancer progression. '
             'Platelets actively contribute to metastasis by shielding '
             'circulating tumor cells from immune surveillance, promoting '
             'vascular remodelling, facilitating extravasation, and releasing '
             'soluble factors that shape the premetastatic niche. '
             'Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles further potentiate these '
             'processes by delivering a heterogeneous cargo of proteins, '
             'nucleic acids, and lipids to endothelial, stromal, and immune '

             'cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Their pathological '
             'overexpression primarily stems from inactivation of the '

             'to detect and are maintained in a resilient state characterized '
             'by a low cell cycling rate. Dormant cancer cells evade immune '

             'HGSOC exhibits a genomic landscape dominated by structural '

{'abstract': 'Cancer immunotherapy has transformed the therapeutic landscape '
             "of oncology by harnessing the body's immune system to recognise "
             'and eliminate malignant cells. In certain tumour types, such as '
             'melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, immune-based therapies '

             'physical barriers underlie this limited efficacy. A major '
             'challenge is the immunosuppressive nature of the tumour '
             'microenvironment (TME), which hampers effective immune cell '
             'infiltration and function. In many solid tumours, chronic '
             'inflammation, poor antigen presentation, a low mutational '
             'burden, and the presence of suppressive myeloid and stromal '
             'cells create an environment resistant to immune activation. In '
             'addition, high intra-tumoral pressure and abnormal vasculature '

             'particularly in desmoplastic cancers such as pancreatic and '
